# SALT
Simple Anti-Leveraging Toolkit
A simple anti-intrusion program which provides assistance to normal antivirus products by running in the background and protecting against my custom 0-days. 
This tool WILL NOT REPLACE your current firewall solution as it does NOT recieve updates from CVE databases like mitre or even the CVE database at exploit-db. This will only protect you from exploits I have discovered.
Note: May not work against polymorphic exploits.
Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any damages, comprimisations, etc. caused by this product failing to perform its duty. I'm a teenage programmer, not a security firm. These are really just insurance to try to make sure people don't get hurt if someone gets their hands on my code. Basically, you take responsability and agree not to sue me if you get hacked or this program corrupts your memory or something.
